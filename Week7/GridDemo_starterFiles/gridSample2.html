			<h2> Enjoy Nature in Luxury</h2>
			<p><span class="resort">Pacific Trails Resort</span> on the California North Coast offers panoramic views of
				the Pacific Ocean. Our guests experience an opulent camping adventure in sumptuously appointed private
				yurts featuring a gas fireplace, king-size bed, and private deck.
			</p>
			<p><span class="resort">Pacific Trails Resort</span> has 5 miles of hiking trails and is adjacent to a state
				park. Go it alone or join one of our guided hikes.</p>
			<p>Ocean kayaks are available for guest use.</p>
			<p>While anytime is a good time for bird watching at Pacific Trails, we offer guided birdwatching
				trips at sunrise several times a week.</p>
			<p>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has
				canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome that can be opened, and a private deck.</p>
			<p>Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down quilt, comfy couch, dining table and
				chairs,
				mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience includes a sink with hot and
				cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</p>
			<p>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of
				clothing.
				It&#39;s also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</p>
